// A family tree is a directed graph which displays familial inheritance. The
// tree has special rules which allow it to be constructed from a collection of
// Person objects:
//
//   - each Person has a maximum of two parents
//   - each Person has its own graph node
//   - the parents of each Person imply an offspring node
//   - edges connect from the parents to the offspring to the Person
//
// These rules are sufficient to generate this inheritance subgraph:
//
//      +--------+        +--------+
//      | Person |        | Person |
//      |(parent)|        |(parent)|
//      +--------+        +--------+
//          |                 |
//          |   +---------+   |
//          +-->|offspring|<--+
//              +---------+
//                   |
//                   v

//              +---------+
//
// Each parent has their own subgraph, as do the children (not depicted) of each
// Person. The TreeBuilder traverses the subgraphs, up to a maximum limit,
// creating the nodes and edges of the full graph as it goes.
//
// The tree is assumed to be acyclic (eg, no time travel allowed). If parents
// contribute to more than one generation, the shape of the tree will differ
// based on the order of node discovery; hence, it is not recommended for use
// with purebred animal or plant heritages without modifications.
